projected ice loss

Antarctica is a vital component of Earth ’s climate system, influencing global sea level, ocean circulation,
and planetary albedo. Major knowledge gaps in critical processes —spanning the atmosphere, ocean,
ice sheets, underlying beds, ice shelves, and sea ice —create uncertainties in future projections, hindering
climate adaptation and risk assessments of ice intervention strategies. Antarctica ’s ice sheet could
contribute 28 centimeters to sea level by 2100, and potentially more if we surpass warming thresholds
that trigger instabilities and rapid retreat. We review recent advances in understanding the changing
stability of the ice sheet margins and identify key processes that require further research. Progress
requires high-resolution satellite data, targeted field campaigns, improved modeling, and refined theory.Increased investment and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential to uncovering Antarctica ’s hidden
processes and reducing uncertainties in future projections.
The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is Earth ’sl a r g e s t
freshwater reservoir, storing enough ice to
add 58 m to global sea level if it all melted,

Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) ( 1). Other land ice
reservoirs are the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS;
7.4 m) and glaciers and ice caps (GIC; 0.5 m).
During the 20th century, global sea level rise
(SLR) was dominated by o cean thermal expan-sion and GIC melt ( 2); however, over the past
two decades, accelerated mass loss from GrIS
and WAIS has made land ice (including GIC)
the largest contribution [( 2,3); Fig. 1A]. Between
1979 and 1989, the total AIS contribution was
just 0.11 mm per year ( 4). In the early 1990s,
AIS SLR contribution st arted to accelerate,
reaching 0.19 mm per year for the period 1992
to 1996 and 0.32 mm per year for 2017 to 2020
(3). Models often do not capture the trends,
leading to large differences between simulatedand observed ice sheet changes. Projections
initialized in 2016 indicate that most simu-
lations produce a growing ice sheet over the
~5-year overlap period with observations, and
this growth persists for several decades before
eventual retreat occurs (Fig. 1B). This leads
to diverging outcomes over time and greater
uncertainty in long-term projections ( 5). Future
AIS mass is so poorly known that the IPCC
considers it “deeply uncertain ”(6). The AIS
could raise sea levels by 28 cm by 2100, equal-
ing the contribution due to thermal expansion,a n du pt o6 . 9mb y2 3 0 0u n d e rh i g he m i s s i o n s
[(6); Fig. 1B], with uneven impacts globally ( 7).
Flood risks are compounded by increased stormi-
ness from climate change, leading to the need
for more complex adaptation strategies ( 8).
WAIS and EAIS have been identified as being
vulnerable to crossing tipping points where
abrupt, irrecoverable change occurs if a thresh-
old in global average temperature is exceeded
(9). The temperature threshold for WAIS is esti-
mated at >1.5°C above preindustrial levels, which
could occur by 2030 ( 10). Owing to its size, thick-
ness, and location, EAIS is thought to be less
sensitive, with a threshold of 4°C, based on re-sponse to past climate perturbations [( 11); Fig. 2A].
These thresholds may be conservative, given
that they are inferred from paleo warming rates
that are much lower than those of today ( 12)
and given the uncertainty in how globally aver-
aged warming manifests in Antarctica. Projec-
tions of ice sheet tipping points are sensitive to
where the models start from (initial conditions),
the geometry of ice and the underlying bed, cli-
mate forcing, representation of the processes
that control the change ( 6,13,14), and model
numerics. Small variat ions in these inputs can
lead to large differences in projected SLR. Deter-
mining the exact timing and magnitude at which
tipping points are reached remains a huge chal-
lenge; therefore, AIS projections diverge widely in
both the onset and magnitude of mass loss ( 8,15).
Uncertainty in future AIS mass loss stems
from a limited understanding of physical pro-
cesses that act at dynamic ice margins, which
are missing or crudely represented in models
(Fig. 2B), combined with uncertain future changes
in climate forcing ( 14,16,17). These processes
are undersampled because they occur on spa-
tial and temporal scales and in locations be-
yond our present observational capabilities
(see the scales of change in Fig. 2B) and involve
complex feedbacks between the AIS, ice shelves,
sea ice, seabed, ocean, and atmosphere ( 2,18), with
insufficient observations ( 19,20). As more dataTHE POLAR WORLD

missions and fieldwork, we are learning more
about these processes, moving us closer to being
able to represent them in models. In this Review,
we summarize key pieces of the Antarctic sys-
tem and the advances in our understanding of
relevant processes, inst abilities, and feedbacks
since 2020, the epoch of the latest IPCC report
(21). We highlight opportunities for impactfulfuture research as we approach the Fifth In-
ternational Polar Year (Box 1).
Pieces of the Antarctic system
Antarctica functions like a millennial-scale fresh-water conveyor belt, accumulating snowfall that
compacts into ice and returning melted fresh-

acts as a heat sink, slowing changes in the globalheat content of Earth ’s atmosphere and oceans
(22). Snowfall and ice accumulate gradually
across the continent, with the total surface mass
balance reaching ~2300 billion tonnes (or giga-
tonnes; Gt) per year ( 23). Being thicker in the in-
terior, ice flows under the influence of gravity to
the margins, where it forms floating ice shelves

freshwater into the Southern Ocean either locally
via meltwater plumes or away from the continent

lanced by losses at the margins. How climate

on how climate forcings evolve and how this
triggers key processes around the margin.
Antarctica ’s subglacial system
is a basal lubricant
The speed of AIS ice flow is influenced by basal
conditions that determine how easily ice slides
over the bed owing to the presence of liquid
water and bed deformability. Fastest ice flow
tends to occur where pressurized water is pre-
sent at the base ( 24). Subglacial water is gen-
erated as ice melts from frictional heat caused
by the glacier flow, geothermal heat flux, and
pressure melting ( 25). Basal meltwater produc-
tion rates are low (millimeters per year) but,
over the vast AIS, the volume is substantial [59 Gt
per year; ( 26)]. The AIS subglacial system is
largely insulated from climate; by contrast, in
Greenland the surface meltwater can reach
the bed to drive a seasonal ice flow cycle ( 27).
Observations of seasonal signals have only re-
cently emerged on the Antarctic Peninsula, which
are primarily attributed to seasonal modulation
of ice-ocean-atmosphere interactions, with par-
ticular sensitivity to glacier terminus change,
ocean temperatures, and surface water avail-
ability that may penetrate to the bed ( 28,29).
Elsewhere, AIS surface melt is mostly confined
to ice shelves ( 30,31) ,b u ti fi tw e r et om i g r a t e
above the grounding line (GL; Fig. 3) and thenreach the bed, some AIS outlets could evolve
toward more seasonally varying flow speeds
and accelerated ice loss [for example, see ( 32)].
Subglacial hydrology is rarely observed, and
so it is either crudely represented in or missing
from models [for example, see ( 33)]. Our ob-
servational capability was transformed in the
mid-2000s by the realization that fluctuations
in local surface elevation are signatures of sub-
glacial hydrology ( 34,35), with satellite laser
altimetry tallying >140 interconnected subgla-
cial lakes that are continuously filling and drain-
ing ( 36). Localized ice flow acceleration has
been observed during periods of subglacial
lake drainage ( 37–39), but the impact on wider
ice sheet dynamics remains poorly sampled ( 40).

another ( 41). Evidence of a deep groundwater
network beneath a WAIS ice stream ( 42)i n d i -
cates another source for subglacial water. It has
been hypothesized that this groundwater inter-action may be crucial on decadal timescales ( 43).
Identifying the sources, thickness, and pressure
of subglacial water beneath the ice sheet will
be critical for understanding its present and
future controls on ice dynamics ( 44,45).
Antarctica ’s ice shelves are buttressing dams
Most AIS outlet glaciers p resently terminate in
ice shelves. Ice shelf contact with pinning points
(where the ice base touches seabed highs) and
lateral shear margins (where ice is in contact
with rock or slow-moving ice) leads to buttress-
ing of upstream ice ( 46). Each basin experiences
drivers of change on different timescales (Fig. 3),
giving each ice shelf a unique ratio of mass loss
processes. If mass losses exceed gains, then
the ice shelf thins and/or the GL retreats, re-
sulting in reduced basal friction, less drag at
pinning points and sidewalls, and less buttress-
ing ( 46,47). As a result, more ice discharges to
the ocean, increasing S LR. Regions where the
grounded AIS is losing the most mass are those
where ice shelves are thinning ( 48). Hence, al-though the net loss of grounded ice determines
SLR, understanding the role of floating ice is
crucial to predict change.
Ice shelf thinning can trigger faster ice flow
hundreds of kilometers away ( 46,49) and can
be especially impactful if it occurs upstream ofas t a b l e “safety zone ”(47)o rc a u s e st h ei c et o
detach from pinning points ( 50,51). Buttress-
ing can be lost through thinning, unpinning, and
complete ice shelf disintegration, a phenome-
non that involves a series of interconnected
processes such as enhanced calving ( 52,53), in-
creased basal melting leading to ice shelf thin-
ning ( 54,55), and, as observed on the Antarctic
Peninsula, “hydrofracture ”that results from ex-
cessive surface melt [( 56); Fig. 3A].
Antarctica ’s sub-ice cavities are the hidden
link to the ocean
Sub-ice cavities host a distinctive ocean environ-
ment where externally driven circulation of heat
and salt couples with buoyant glacial meltwater
generated by basal melting. Key factors that
influence basal melt rates include ice depth
and basal slope as well as seabed geometry
(57,58). Ice shelves are often classified as cold
or warm cavity, with distinct modes of melting
and circulation (Fig. 3B). In reality, multiple
modes and combinations of oceanic conditionscan influence a single ice shelf at different times
and locations ( 57,59). In warm cavities such as
in the Amundsen Sea, Circumpolar Deep Water
can exceed the local freezing point temperature
by 2°C ( 60,61), with models suggesting that it
would take 3 years to travel to the GL ( 62),
where it drives melt rates of 10 to 100 m per
year ( 63). In cold cavities, such as the Amery
Ice Shelf, melt rates near the deep GL (Fig. 3B)
are highest because the in situ freezing point
temperature decreases with pressure ( 64). The
resulting cold Ice Shelf Water can refreeze as
marine ice at shallow ice drafts, redistributing
ice (57,59,63) and stabilizing ice shelves ( 65).
In both cavity types, rapid melting can occur at
the ice fronts because of more energetic oceanic
conditions as well as warmer upper-ocean wa-
ters in summer ( 66,67).
Future changes in Southern Ocean temper-
ature, circulation, and sea ice conditions could
shift the distribution of basal melting and re-
freezing ( 68). The complex interplay between
buoyant intrusions of subglacial meltwater
(69), ice-base geometry ( 58), and turbulent pro-
cesses near the ice-ocean boundary leads to the
emergence of several other melting and freezing
regimes that are understudied ( 59,70). Substan-

environment, including bed geometry, oceanBox 1. Bridging the gaps in SLR projections.
The wide range of present Antarctic SLR projections is too broad
for policy-makers to use effectively. Improving these projections
requires a better understanding of mass balance processes,
especially those occurring on short spatial (~100 m to ~1 km) and
temporal (daily to seasonal) scales, which are presently underrepresented
in models because observations have been insufficient in space and time.
Main knowledge gaps
To reduce uncertainties in Antarctic mass loss and better inform policy decisions
and adaptation strategies, we must ad vance knowledge of the following:
•Subglacial hydrology, basal processes, and internal ice deformation
and structure
•Ice sheet geometry and the potential for MISI
•GZ state and variability and the role of buttressing
•Sub–ice shelf cavity melting, ocean circulation, and ice-ocean
interactions
•Fracturing and calving dynamics and the potential for MICI
•Feedbacks between the ice sheet, sea ice, and other parts of the climate system
•Interactions between global climate and regional climate at the ice
sheet margin, includingaccumulation and surface warming
These knowledge gaps require mapping of the seabed and
bedrock underlying the ice sheet, determination of the properties under
the grounded ice and floating ice s helves, enhanced simulation and
modeling, and stronger interdisciplinary and multinational research
to investigate feedbacks.
Essential actions
•Advance understanding of processe s by monitoring relevant variables
across a range of space and time scales with airborne and satellitemissions that ensure continuity and i nnovation through high-resolution,
frequent sampling: Key future missions include the NASA –ISRO Synthetic
Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission (ice velocity and deformation), the
European Space Agency ’sC o p e r n i c u sP o l a rI c ea n dS n o wT o p o g r a p h y
Altimeter (CRISTAL) mission (surface elevation), and the proposed
Earth Dynamics Geodetic Explorer (EDGE) mission (surface elevation)
•Perform targeted field observations for evaluation and calibration of remote-
sensing techniques and to develop field-based understanding of processes
•Expand field observations beyond WAIS, particularly to at-risk EAIS
outlet glaciers and ice shelves
•Develop high-fidelity simulations that exploit progress in closing
the main knowledge gaps and the reproduction of observed changes
for future projections with substantially reduced uncertainties, for
example, Ice Sheet Modeling Intercomparison for the seventh IPCC
Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project –Phase 7 (ISMIP7)
•Educate and inspire the next generation of Antarctic ice sheet
researchers
•Provide actionable projections with well-constrained uncertainties that
inform policy decisions a nd adaptation strategies
Funding and advocacy
Strong advocacy for Antarctic rese arch is crucial to secure sustained
funding and refine projections, which are essential for guiding climate
policies and global adaptation strategies. This requires enhanced coordination
among scientific, governmental, pub lic, and private stakeholders, as
well as increased international collaboration [e.g., coordinated through
the Climate and Cryosphere (CLiC) project and the Scientific
Committee on Antarctic Research ’s INStabilities & Thresholds in
ANTarctica (SCAR INSTANT)
research program].THE POLAR WORLD

Antarctica ’s grounding zones are complex
intertidal estuaries
Antarctic ice first meets the sub –ice shelf cavity
at the GL, which can migrate with ocean tides to
create a grounding zone (GZ; Fig. 4), where theice transitions from being always grounded to
always floating. Ice flowing across the GL typ-
ically thins rapidly, as a result of stretching as
basal friction is removed and high basal melt
rates ( 63). Underwater surveys have revealed that
basal melt close to the GL varies down to submeter
scales as a result of local variations in basal ice
topography ( 61). Autonomous phase-sensitive
r a d i oe c h os o u n d i n g( A p R E S )i n s t r u m e n t sh a v erevolutionized the measurement of basal melt
rates; however, these techniques are difficult to
apply in flexure zones, regions of crevassing, or
where firn compaction rates and vertical shear
profiles are difficult to determine ( 71–73). ApRES-
derived estimates of melt rates can be combined
with estimates from satellite-derived ice thickness
changes ( 63); however, these are undersampled
in the GZ owing to complex surface topography

and the breakdown of hydrostatic equilibrium
(74), creating an observation gap in regions
where melt rates are the highest.
Recent studies have shown that seawater
intrusions driven by ocean tides can penetrate
the GZ (Fig. 4), causing variations in basal
melt on short timescales ( 75). Satellite-based
radar interferometry ( 76–78) and laser altim-
etry observations ( 79) with high spatial reso-
lution and frequent temporal sampling reveal
that the GL can migrate up to 15 km between
low and high tide, pumpi ng relatively warm,
salty ocean water further beneath the ice sheet
every few hours ( 80). Significant long-term GL
retreat and acceleration in Amundsen Sea gla-
ciers has been attributed to vigorous ice-ocean
interactions in their GZs ( 75,81).
Evidence is also emerging of a link between
subglacial hydrology and ice shelf basal melt-
ing (Fig. 4). Injection of freshwater across the
GZ into the ice cavity can enhance melting that
reduces ice shelf buttressing, which has been
proposed as an important mechanism for some
EAIS glaciers ( 69,82). Models suggest that under
high greenhouse gas emissions, this effect can
increase the SLR contribution of a drainage
basin by up to 30% ( 83). Focused discharge of
subglacial freshwater across the GL can drive
the development of large basal channels that
mechanically weaken the ice shelf ( 75). Some
studies have observed tens of kilometers of mi-
gration of seawater underneath the ice sheet,
along estuaries formed by subglacial hydrology
i nt h eG Z ,w h e r ew a t e rc a nb et r a p p e df o rw e e k s
before draining ( 77,80). Some models predict that
the density difference between fresh subglacial
discharge and salty o cean water can form a “salt
wedge ”that permits the diffusion of seawater up
to several kilometers upstream of the GZ ( 84,85).
This layered seawater intrusion theory —distinct
from, yet potentially occurring alongside, the
tidal intrusion mechanism —remains unobserved
in Antarctica with present observational capa-
b i l i t i e s .S u c hi r r e g u l a r ,w i d e s p r e a di n t e r a c t i o n s
between ice and seawater in the GZ could be
i m p a c t f u lo nA I Se v o l u t i o n( 85–87), potentially
doubling future SLR contributions ( 88); there
is also a suggestion that this may introduce
new tipping-point behaviors ( 89,90). Explicit
representations of these GZ melt processes are
m i s s i n gf r o mm o s ti c es h e e tm o d e l s( 80).
Another GZ interaction involves sediment
transfer from the ice sheet to the ocean, which
can influence the stability of the GZ ( 91,92)
(Fig. 4). Depositional features can also give in-
sights into present and past ice dynamics; for
example, more than 75 “GZ wedges ”have been
identified on the Antarct ic seafloor, which form
as sediment is delivered to the GZ during pe-
riods where the ice margin remains stable for a
long time ( 93). GZ wedges, which are typically
<15 km long and 15 to 100 m thick, can act as
topographic pinning points that can stabilize the
GL, with evidence that they halted WAIS retreatfor hundreds to thousands of years during the
last deglaciation ( 94). Smaller amplitude, regular-
ly spaced corrugation ridges observed offshore of
Thwaites Glacier and Larsen Inlet are thought to
record sequential low-tide seafloor sediment
imprints that may provide evidence of rapid GL
retreat of hundreds of meters per day during
the last deglaciation ( 95,96). Similar features in
Pine Island Bay have been interpreted as the im-
print of icebergs dragging on the seafloor at tidal
frequencies ( 97). Although there are few direct
observations, understanding feedbacks between
ice dynamics and sediment redistribution in GZs
is essential for interpreting their past stabilityand projecting future ice sheet retreat.
Antarctica ’s sea ice regulates global climate and
ice sheet change
Antarctica ’s surrounding sea ice (Fig. 2A) covers
an area of ~18.5 × 106km2(~6% of the global
ocean) at its winter maximum (September) and
shrinks to nearly 16% of that in summer ( 98). Sea
ice is a dynamic, seasonally varying component of
the Antarctic environment, exerting a strong in-
f l u e n c eo nt h eo c e a na n dc l i m a t e( 17). Sea ice
increases Earth ’s albedo, reflecting incoming solar
radiation, and helps to regulate global tempera-
ture ( 99). The seasonal formation and melt of sea
ice modifies ocean salinity and temperature, alter-
ing stratification and circulation patterns that
govern the distribution of heat along the conti-
nental shelf, shaped by regional weather patterns
and climate feedbacks ( 100). These processes de-
termine where and how relatively warm waters
can melt ice shelves, which can influence ice shelf
stability and future sea level rise [for example, see
(101,102)]. In turn, changes in ice shelf melting can
affect sea ice, generating complex climate feed-
backs ( 103). Sea ice also plays a crucial role in
marine ecosystem activity ( 104).
A significant and unpredicted decline in
Antarctic sea ice extent began in 2016, with par-
tial recovery in 2019 to 2020 followed by con-
secutive years of near-historic lows ( 105), leading
to increased coastal exposure to open water
(106). The lowest annual sea ice extent was 1.79 ×
106km2in February 2023, which is ~10% less
than the 2022 record low that marked the first
time annual minimum extent dropped below
2×1 06km2(107). The ongoing decline signals
a major shift in Southern Ocean conditions
(105), which has implications for sea ice and its
i n f l u e n c eo nt h eA I S ,t h eb r o a d e rc l i m a t es y s -
tem ( 108,109) and ecosystems ( 110). Sea ice
thickness —a key factor for ice strength, landfast
ice formation, and summer survival —is challeng-
ing to measure in Antarctica because of thick
snow cover, flooding, and difficulty in resolving
leads to provide relative freeboard assessments
(111). Accurately mapping sea ice freeboard and
structure at scales that capture most sea ice floes
(Fig. 2B) is essential for providing the detailed
data needed to improve models of sea ice evolu-
tion ( 112) and explain why change has occurred.Instabilities and feedbacks of the
Antarctic system
Geometric instabilities at dynamic ice margins
Simple relationships predict the potential for two
geometry-based high-end retreat scenarios, which
are considered to be possible AIS instabilities: the
marine ice sheet instability (MISI) and the marine
ice cliff instability (MICI). MISI is based on the
u n d e r s t a n d i n gt h a tb e c a u s es e a w a r di c ef l u xi n -
creases with ice thickness, GLs located on retro-
grade bed slopes are inherently unstable ( 113,114).
In such locations, the weakening or loss of ice shelf
buttressing can trigger a self-sustaining draw-
down at the ice margins: Initial thinning causesthe GL to retreat into deeper water, where a higher
s t r a i nr a t ei n c r e a s e sm a s sl o s sf r o mt h ei c es h e e t ,
leading to further retreat and thinning. Although
some studies suggest that MISI is underway in
WAIS ( 81,115), others suggest that present-day
GL retreat is driven by external climate forcing
alone ( 116), though continued warming may even-
tually lead to MISI onset ( 117). Some EAIS outlets
are also potentially vulnerable to MISI ( 118,119).
MICI is predicated on simple force balance argu-
ments that suggest that the stable height to which
a marine-terminating ice cliff (Fig. 2B) can grow is
limited by ice strength to ~100 m ( 120). If trig-
gered, unstable cliff failure can repeatedly expose
thicker ice upstream, driving rapid ice loss at the
margin ( 121). As proposed, MICI could contribute
multimeter SLR on century timescales ( 2).
MICI remains controversial and has not been
directly observed in Antarctica, although obser-
vations of speed-up and enhanced calving at thick
marine-terminating glaciers after ice shelf loss
have been noted at Crane Glacier on the Antarctic
Peninsula ( 122) and in Greenland ( 123). Paleo
records of iceberg plow ridges in Pine Island Bay
(124), previously attributed to grounding of float-
ing ice during breakup ( 97), have been cited as
indirect evidence for MICI. By contrast, a statis-
tical analysis of modeling uncertainties ( 125)c o n -
cluded that MICI is not required to reproduce
sea level estimates in the geologic past. Process-
based modeling suggests that slow ice shelf loss
can mitigate MICI, but outcomes vary widely de-
pending on assumptions of ice properties and icestrength ( 126). Other models suggest that speed-
up and dynamic thinning of unbuttressed ice
fronts can suppress ice cliff calving in the absence
of ice shelves ( 127,128). An incomplete under-
standing of the material properties (strength) of
glacial ice and the processes involved in triggering
and amplifying ice shelf loss, calving, and cliff re-
treat ( 129,130) continues to make the role of MICI
in retreat scenarios difficult to parameterize and
quantify ( 131,132). Given the potential for MICI
(and fracture and calving processes in general) to
contribute to future ice loss, rifting and calving at
thick ice margins should be further evaluated
through observations at spatial and temporalscales relevant to processes involved in ice shelf,
glacier, and ice front stability. Further research on
the initiation and propagation of fracturing, theTHE POLAR WORLD

role of GL location and flo ating versus grounded
ice, upstream ice thickness gradients, surface melt,
bedrock shape, and flow velocities is needed.
Feedbacks at dynamic ice sheet margins
Processes at AIS dynamic margins are inter-connected and can compound. For example, ice
front retreat due to increased iceberg calving
can increase ocean heat supply to the deep GL
(133,134). Enhanced basal melting leads to ice
shelf thinning and the incision of basal chan-nels ( 135), leaving ice shelves more susceptible
to hydrofracture ( 136). Processes acting in cer-
tain locations, such as ba sal melting or rifting
along shear margins or p inning points, can have
a disproportionate impact, triggering rapid ice
shelf retreat and flow acceleration ( 137,138). This
can potentially lead to more crevassing, rifting,
and ice front retreat. Such feedbacks have been
implicated in the ongoing retreat and accelera-
tion of Pine Island Glacier ( 53,139).
Not all feedbacks at ice sheet margins are posi-
tive. For example, ice sheet models accounting for
glacial-isostatic adjustm ent, including the gravi-
tational, rotational, and deformational response
of a viscoelastic Earth to changing ice loads
(140), demonstrate that bedrock uplift and a
local sea level drop in the vicinity of retreating
GZs can slow retreat. The effect is strongest in
West Antarctica, where the mantle has relatively
low viscosity ( 141), allowing for faster uplift rates.
This negative feedback could slow both MISI-
and MICI-driven retreat, although it will weaken
a st h ep a c eo fA I Si c el o s si n c r e a s e s .Feedbacks between coastal processes and the AIS
The configuration of the coastal icescape (sea ice,fast ice, and icebergs) affects mass-loss processes
(Fig. 3) through modification of ocean properties
(142). Sea ice may enhance buttressing ( 106,143),
mitigate the impacts of swells ( 144,145)a n dt s u -
namis ( 146,147) on ice fracture, and reduce fron-
tal melting and small-scale calving ( 148,149).
This role is amplified when thick landfast sea
ice forms, anchored by complex coastlines and
grounded icebergs ( 150), which affects polynya
activity, associated abyssal ventilation, and the
properties of water masses entering the cavity
(151). Large calving events can greatly reduce
polynya activity and the production of dense
water that ventilates the abyssal global oceans
(152). Poorly constrained calving models, lim-
ited water depth data, and complex sea ice
physics hinder projections of changes in the
coastal icescape.
AIS response to large-scale climate variability
Climate variability modes like the Southern An-nular Mode and El Niño –Southern Oscillation
influence ocean properties on the continental
shelf ( 153), sea ice extent ( 154), and ice sheet/shelf
surface mass accumulation ( 155), affecting the
changing mass balance of WAIS ice shelves ( 156)
and the grounded AIS ( 157). Modeling studies
project that some cold-cavity ice shelves could
transition to warm cavities by 2100 ( 158,159),
caused in part by feedbacks as initial inflows of
warm ocean waters drive melting that intensifies
the cavity overturning circulation, continuing todraw in warmer water. However, these transi-
tions may be delayed because an initial response
to climate warming can involve a weakened
sub-ice circulation and lowered basal melt
rates ( 160).
Keeping track of the pieces of the
Antarctic system
Antarctica ’s size and remoteness mean that
changes on a continental scale can be tracked only
by satellite. Three complementary techniques
track grounded AIS mass: gravimetry; mass fluxes
from ice flow rates, ice thickness, and climate
models; and elevation changes combined witha firn density model. These techniques can then
be combined ( 3). The net AIS mass budget is
shaped by snow accumulation and seaward ice
flow, influenced by complex interactions among
the atmosphere, ocean, and ice ( 48), which oc-
cur on multiple scales. Therefore, comprehen-
sive monitoring should span broad spatial and
temporal scales, resolving features such as outlet
glaciers ( 28,161)a n di c es h e l v e s( 63)w h i l ea l s o
capturing seasonal to annual changes. Only three
studies have provided a comprehensive assess-
ment of grounded and floating ice using the
s a m ed a t ao v e rt h es a m et i m ep e r i o d( 48,162,163)
(Fig. 2A). Observations at higher spatial and tem-
poral resolution can inform about processes not
yet captured in models.
Broad-scale monitoring
Between 1992 and 2020, AIS experienced an over-all net mass loss of grounded ice ( 3), dominated
by trends in WAIS (82 ± 9 Gt per year) and the
Antarctic Peninsula (13 ± 5 Gt per year). Most
WAIS changes occur in the Amundsen Sea basins,
where glaciers have accelerated because of reduced
ice shelf buttressing and GL retreat ( 46,48,54).
EAIS is near steady state or in slightly positive
balance because losses from increased ocean-
driven melt are offset by gains from increased
inland snowfall, which is attributed to a warm-
ing and more moisture-laden atmosphere ( 3,48).
Between 2003 and 2018, mass gains were con-
centrated in Queen Maud Land, whereas mass
loss occurred in several M ISI-susceptible ice out-
lets draining the Auror a and Wilkes subglacial
basins ( 48), accompanied by GL retreat ( 164). Flow
rates have increased in numerous EAIS outlets on
both grounded ice [e.g., Cook Glacier ( 165)a n d
Vanderford Glacier ( 166)] and floating ice [e.g.,
ice shelves of Scott Glacier ( 167), Totten Glacier
(168), and Denman Glacier ( 169)].
Snow accumulation across AIS increased sig-
nificantly between 2019 and 2023 ( 170). In WAIS,
much of the mass gain was due to short-period
extreme events, such as atmospheric rivers (ARs)
(170–172). In 2019 to 2020 alone, this reduced
WAIS ’s SLR contribution by 60 ± 16 Gt per year
(170). Record mass gains occurred in 2022 ( 173),
primarily because of an increase in precipitation
events over EAIS, including ARs. In March 2022,

several kilometers across the GZ (from GL lowto GL high). Processes acting in and around the GZ —driven by interactions
between ice, bedrock, sediment, sub glacial hydrology, and the ocean —can vary on short spatial and temporal scales. Tides
can pump relatively warm seawater kilometers inland, enhancing basal melting in and upstream of the GZ. Subglacial water
flux from the ice sheet bed to the ocean across the GL can al so enhance basal melting in the GZ, which can lead to the
development of basal channels that are visible in satellite altimetry as surface depressions. Sediment flux into the sub –ice
shelf cavity can increase GL stability. All of these interactio ns can influence long-term ice dy namics. Figure is not to scale.

306 Gt of precipitation ( 174), accounting for 32%
of the total AIS precipitation for that month, and
up to 90% in some parts of EAIS, particularly
Wilkes Land. AR intensity may be linked to
interannual climate modes, but both the in-
tensity and frequency of extreme precipita-
tion events are expected to rise as the climate
warms throughout the 21st century ( 172).
An open question is whether increased snow-
fall in the AIS interior will be sufficient to
offset increased melting and calving at the
margins.
Process-based understanding
Recent satellite data s how changes on process-
relevant spatial and temporal scales. In WAIS,
Pine Island Glacier Ice Shelf transitioned in 2015
from a previously quasi-stable cycle of advance
and retreat at its calving front to a calving regime
characterized by more frequent calving of tabular
icebergs (Fig. 3B) and calving front retreat ( 175)
(Fig. 3B). Portions of the Thwaites ice tongue un-
derwent an abrupt change from a previously in-
tact ice shelf into fragmented remnants ( 176,177).
Studies of ice shelf rifts have suggested that their
activity may relate to internal formation mechan-
ics (178)a n dg l a c i o l o g i c a ls t r e s s e sa sw e l la st o
atmospheric and oceanic forcings, for exam-
ple, winds ( 179), sea surface slope or wave swell
(180,181)a n dt s u n a m i s( 147), ocean circulation
(61), and strength of intrarift mélange ( 182).
Observations of ice shelves with short calving
cycles (Fig. 3A) have shown that ocean and at-
mospheric forcings can lead to ungrounding
from pinning points, dri ving increased calving
rates, for example, at Pine Island Glacier around
2006 ( 133), Thwaites Glacier ( 183), and Thwaites
Eastern Ice Shelf ( 177,184). At Thwaites, the
evolving interaction w ith a pinning point after
the loss of Thwaites Western Ice Tongue in
2008 likely triggered shearing and fracture
propagation related to enhanced weakening
(137,178,185), with another ungrounding anti-
cipated within the next decade ( 50).
In East Antarctica, there have been many
signs of change, for example, recent terminus
change after sea ice breakout ( 186) and GL
retreat ( 166,187), but the first observed ice
shelf disappearance was Conger-Glenzer in
2022 ( 55), after decades of retreat that began
in the late 1990s when small calving events
isolated it from Shackleton Ice Shelf. This was
followed by phases of retreat, relative stability,
and ultimate rapid disintegration driven by
long-term thinning, reduced buttressing effect,
and ungrounding from a pinning point. The
evolution of the Shackleton-Denman system
itself involved structural changes in the floating
shear margins, rift propagation, and small-scale
calving ( 167), possibly aided by seawater infil-
tration in some regions adjacent to Shackleton
Ice Shelf ( 164,188) that may affect ice rheology

responding to warming.Antarctica as a target for “ice intervention ”
to mitigate sea level rise
Intervention to slow ice loss has recently been
suggested ( 190,191), with two primary strategies.
Underwater curtains would divert warm water
from reaching the ice outlets and redirect colder
water toward them instead, potentially slowing
i c em e l ta n dG Zr e t r e a t( 192). Whether this will
actually slow overall AIS mass loss is uncertain
(193); it might simply reroute warm water to
other ice shelves ( 194). Drilling and drying strat-
egies aim to stabilize glaciers by increasing basal
friction of sliding ice streams by drilling deep
holes and removing lubr icating water from the
subglacial drainage system. This idea is based on
observations of natural processes at Kamb Ice
Stream. However, most outlets differ markedly
from Kamb, and the actual impact on glacier slid-
ing is expected to be highly dependent on poorly
m a p p e da n dm o d e l e db e da n d basal conditions.
Because subglacial water is constantly replen-
ished and may be connected to underlying ground-
water ( 42), any impact would be short-term,
and any efforts would need to be sustained.
Geoengineering in Antarctica faces immense
challenges owing to its vast scale, technical and
logistical difficulties, harsh polar conditions, and
environmental concerns, including impacts on
marine life and the risk of contaminating sub-
glacial areas ( 195). Perhaps the greatest risk,
however, lies in unintended consequences from
our limited understanding of how ice sheets re-
spond to climate and human activities. With the
guiding principle of “first, do no harm, ”it is cru-
cial that we prioritize improving our knowledge.
This will help us better assess our options for the
future and make informed decisions about what
actions we can responsibly take. Effective meth-
ods will necessitate substantial, long-term invest-
ments in research, infrastructure, and ongoing
monitoring —resources that would be more wise-
ly allocated to addressing the fundamental deep
uncertainties instead ( 195).
Commitment to change
The AIS is expected to continue losing ice in re-
sponse to the heat already absorbed by the cli-mate system ( 196). To date, only a small fraction
of this global heat imbalance has contributed to
AIS melting ( 22,163). Increased melt rates for
WAIS may be committed for the next century
(197) .T h ep a c ea n de x t e n to fA I Se v o l u t i o na r e
uncertain ( 198,199), influenced by the instabil-
ities and feedbacks discussed here, and other
processes that remain underobserved, or un-
known altogether. Projected rapid ice loss would
partially offset global warming ( 200)b yc o n -
verting the heat into ice melt but would still
cause SLR and alter ocean circulation as a result
of the cooling and freshening of the oceans.
Uncertainty remains ov er how much Antarctica
will warm within the Paris Agreement ’s1 . 5 ° Ct a r g e t ,
owing to climate model uncertainties and potential
polar amplification, which could cause Antarcticato warm sooner and exceed the global average.
Even without the expected amplified warming, a
global target of 1.5°C may not prevent the AIS from
crossing tipping points within decades ( 9). The re-
sponse timescale of the AIS is deeply uncertain,
but its future contribution to SLR (Fig. 1B) could
substantially exceed the IPCC medium-confidence
projections within the next decades to century ( 2,5).
Summary and outlook
Antarctica stores a vas ta m o u n to ff r e s h w a t e r ,
and its future evolution is the largest cause of
uncertainty in SLR projections. Most of this un-
certainty stems from insufficient understandingof key processes that affect the marginal ice
shelves that buttress the ice sheet and the re-
sponse of grounded ice when ice shelves are lost.
Present observations are insufficient, in both
space and time, to constrain the mechanisms
responsible for abrupt mass loss, leaving them
only crudely represented or missing entirely from
ice sheet models. The impact of seasonal to dec-
adal variations in climate forcing is also uncertain.
Constraining the uncertainty in AIS evolution
requires radically improved understanding of
its mass-loss processes. Adequate sampling and
tracking of changes can only be achieved through
cooperative, new, and sustained observations
from satellites and in situ observations (both on
ice and in the surrounding ocean), combined
with high-fidelity modeling to investigate key
processes related to ice-ocean interactions, sur-
face melting, and fracture of ice (Box 1).
Sir Douglas Mawson ’s words about his 1914
Antarctic expedition, “We had come to probe its
mystery, we had hoped to reduce it to terms of
s c i e n c e ,b u tt h e r ew a sa l w a y st h e ‘indefinable ’
which held aloof, yet riveted our souls, ”remain
relevant in 2025. Our comprehension may always
be incomplete, leaving open the likelihood that
Antarctica ’s complexities surpass our capacity for
complete understanding. However, societies need
to understand Antarctica to be able to adapt in
response to its changes. Yet despite this dire need
and deep uncertainty, the pace of progress remains
too slow, underscoring the need for a fundamental
shift in our approach to polar science as we beginto identify and understand the once-indefinable
unknowns. As we approach the Fifth Interna-
t i o n a lP o l a rY e a r( 2 0 3 1 –2033), present limitations
in observations and models highlight that polar
science remains underequipped to fully address
the complexities of Antarctica ’ss y s t e m .W ea r ea ta
time when a substantial increase in resourcing
is needed to provide transformative advancements
in research tools, data collection, and modeling
capabilities, which are essential to unravel the
key processes that shape the evolution of Earth ’s
largest freshwater reservoir and to finally answer
the critical questions: How much and how fast?
