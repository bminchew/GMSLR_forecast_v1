Key Points:13
•Ice sheet model projections are sensitive to the choice of flow law exponent, which 14
governs how ice viscosity responds to changes in stress. 15
•Models incorrectly assumingn= 3 can be initialized to matchn= 4 glaciers, 16
but significantly underestimate ice loss in retreat benchmarks. 17
•This bias increases with the speed of retreat, indicating a need to assess uncer- 18
tainty from ice rheology mismatches in sea level projections. 19

Abstract20
Glacier flow plays a major role in current and future rates of globally averaged sea- 21
level rise. The viscosity of glacial ice, controlling the rate of flow, decreases as stress in- 22
creases and is highly sensitive to the value of the stress exponent,n, in the constitutive 23
equation for viscous flow. Glaciologists and climate modelers almost exclusively assume 24
n= 3 when modeling ice flow and projecting sea-level rise through forward modeling. 25
However, recent work suggests thatn≈4 better fits observations, prompting the ques- 26
tion: How sensitive are projections of sea-level rise to the value ofn? We use an estab- 27
lished community ice flow model and standard benchmark experiments designed as an 28
idealized representation of Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica. While initializing an 29
n= 3 model to match observations of ann= 4 ice sheet is possible, we find that in- 30
correctly assumingn= 3 when in factn= 4 dramatically underestimates rates of sea- 31
level rise. The scale of this error grows nonlinearly with the magnitude of the climate 32
forcing, acting to increase projection uncertainties. Additionally, we find that models of- 33
ten account for this stress-dependent rheology mismatch during model initialization in 34
a way that masks this rheological effect in the short term while leaving model outputs 35
vulnerable to larger biases in longer-term projections. Initializations to observations of 36
Pine Island Glacier display similar rheology-mismatch fingerprints to our idealized ex- 37
ample.38
Plain Language Summary 39
The ice found in glaciers and ice sheets responds to applied stresses with reduced 40
resistance to flow and deformation: push twice as hard, get more than twice the flow. 41
We can model this behavior with a stress-dependent viscosity whose exponent,n, gov- 42
erns the sensitivity of flow to changes in stress. Recent work suggests thatn= 4 in many 43
regions, departing from the current standard practice ofn= 3, a pervasive assumption 44
that underpins all existing sea level projections that depend on modeling the flow of ice 45
sheets. We ask: If numerical ice sheet models have been using incorrect values ofn, how 46
does that affect their model projections for ice sheet change? We show that in bench- 47
mark models of marine ice sheets typically found in Antarctica, usingn= 3 whenn 48
should be 4 leads to underestimates of 100-year sea-level rise contributions of between 49
21% and 35% depending on the climate forcing. Our work highlights that a simple quan- 50
tity prescribed for the physical behavior of ice has far reaching implications for model- 51
ing of ice sheets and understanding future sea level rise. 52
1 Introduction53
The present reality of global sea level rise (SLR) will impact hundreds of millions 54
of people globally by 2100 (Kulp & Strauss, 2019; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). The mag- 55
nitude and timing of SLR risk depends on the dynamic response of ice sheets and glaciers 56
to changes in climate, particularly in response to marine forcing from incursion of warmer 57
water into the cavities under ice shelves. The dynamic response of ice sheets, in turn, 58
depends fundamentally on the viscosity of glacial ice and its response to perturbations 59
within the ice column and in the environment. 60
The ice found within glaciers and ice sheets deforms as a “shear-thinning” (strain- 61
weakening) non-Newtonian viscous fluid. (Budd & Jacka, 1989) To model this behav- 62
ior, ice flow is often represented using a power law rheology (J. Glen, 1952). Convention- 63
ally, most ice sheet models assume Glen’s Flow Law (J. W. Glen & Perutz, 1955) to de- 64
scribe the relationship between the deviatoric stress tensorτ ijand strain rate tensor ˙ε ij: 65
τij= 2η˙ε ijwithη=τ1−n

where the dynamic viscosityηis a function ofτ=p
τijτij/2, the square root of the 66
second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, and the prefactorA n=A 0,nexp−Q
RT67
which is a function of absolute temperatureT, the universal gas constantR, and ma- 68
terial properties such as activation energyQand those represented byA 0,n, which has 69
units of Pa−na−1(Budd & Jacka, 1989; K. M. Cuffey & Paterson, 2010). The flow law 70
exponentnis taken to be a scalar where different values indicate particular mechanisms 71
of deformation (Goldsby & Kohlstedt, 2001). Laboratory experiments show that the phys- 72
ical mechanisms for ice deformation, and thus the values ofA nandn, vary depending 73
on stress, temperature, and impurity content (Schulson & Duval, 2009; Goldsby & Kohlst- 74
edt, 2001). While experimental data suggest a wide variability in the viscous parame- 75
ters (Bromer & Kingery, 1968; Duval et al., 1983; Goldsby & Kohlstedt, 2001; Steine- 76
mann, 1954), ice sheet models have historically assumedn= 3 as the standard, and 77
only, value of the flow law exponent (e.g., S. Cornford et al. (2013); Larour et al. (2012); 78
Hoffman et al. (2018); Lipscomb et al. (2019); Gagliardini et al. (2013); Khrulev et al. 79
(2025)).80
Recently, however, analysis of observational and in situ data suggests that a higher 81
value of the flow law exponent may better match the behavior of ice flow at scales rel- 82
evant to the natural world (Bons et al., 2018; K. Cuffey & Kavanaugh, 2011; Gillet-Chaulet 83
et al., 2011; Jezek et al., 1985; Millstein et al., 2022; Fan et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025). 84
For at least some of the deformation regimes most commonly observed in areas with high 85
strain rates in the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets, these results suggest thatn= 86
4 can better represent observations than the canonicaln= 3. As a specific example, 87
Millstein et al. (2022) infern= 4.1±0.4 based on observations of ice deformation and 88
thickness in Antarctic ice shelves, with largely unquantified implications for modeling 89
the evolution of ice sheets and their contribution to sea-level rise. 90
In recent years, the ice sheet modeling community has contributed a number of in- 91
creasingly sophisticated projections of SLR designed to inform climate scientists and decision- 92
makers (e.g., S. L. Cornford et al. (2015); Seroussi et al. (2020); Edwards et al. (2021); 93
Seroussi et al. (2024)). Since most, if not all, contemporary ice sheet models use flow laws 94
withn= 3, this leaves open the question of what implications the higher value ofn= 95
4, and resulting nonlinearity, might have on ice sheet model projections and the under- 96
standing of ice sheet dynamics that has been gleaned from their use. For example, Getraer 97
and Morlighem (2025) performed a set of experiments based on the ISMIP6 projection 98
experiments (Seroussi et al., 2020) and found that using ann= 4 rheology resulted in 99
a 32±14% increase in ice loss from the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE), in West Antarc- 100
tica by 2100 compared with similar projections withn= 3 and a roughly 70±15% 101
increase by 2300. However, in the same region, Sergienko (2025) found a more limited 102
impact, with consequences on ice thickness and speed limited to around 5%. These con- 103
tested uncertainties in SLR projections arising from an unresolved uncertainty innmo- 104
tivate this study, where we employ the framework of simple and relevant community model 105
benchmarks to explore the impacts of a higher than typical value ofn. 106
We look to gain understanding of the impacts of incorrectly initializing a model 107
withn= 3 to match a spun up ice sheet state with the true value ofn= 4, and then 108
comparing resulting projections of the behavior of the incorrectly initializedn= 3 model 109
against the truen= 4 ice sheet. Our approach is motivated by simplicity, where we 110
aim to analyze the discrepancies betweenn= 3 andn= 4 projections in a controlled 111
set-up. Our ability to prescribe the true value ofnand other relevant parameters, gen- 112
erate synthetic data used to initialize ice-flow models from prescribed (and known) para- 113
metric values, and initialize our model with values ofnthat differ from the true value 114
allows us to isolate and assess how the model results differ between the true model and 115
one that assumes a different value ofn. To our knowledge, this is the first study to take 116
this approach. Previous studies by Getraer and Morlighem (2025) and Sergienko (2025) 117
use observations of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, where the value of and uncertainties innand 118

other relevant physical parameters are not fully constrained, introducing unexplored and 119
unquantified parametric uncertainties into their results that do not exist in our ideal- 120
ized study. In this way, our study complements and expands on the findings of these pre- 121
vious studies by targeting a simple comparison ice flow and different stress responses. 122
2 Methods123
2.1 The Role of Observations in Ice Sheet Modeling 124
Ice sheet models require spatially-varying parameter fields which are not easily ob- 125
served, like the coefficient of friction at the beds of glaciers and parameters which rep- 126
resent local deviations from the standard Glen’s Law due to local physical processes like 127
damage, ice fabric and grain size, strain-induced heating and other localized and tran- 128
sient thermal effects, interstitial liquid water content, and impurities. To address this 129
when simulating present-day ice sheets, ice sheet modelers commonly create initial con- 130
ditions for their experiments to match (as best as possible) observations of existing ice 131
sheets. The observations include basal topography, surface elevation, and ice velocities. 132
In ice sheet models, the ice velocities are obtained by solving a system of nonlinear par- 133
tial differential equations derived from the momentum balance. Many, if not most, ice 134
sheet modelers reproduce a fit to observed velocities for a given ice geometry by infer- 135
ring values for the (harder to measure) basal friction coefficient and some combination 136
of viscous parameters, such asA 0,norT. (MacAyeal, 1993; Morlighem & Goldberg, 2023) 137
In this study, we use the BISICLES model (S. Cornford et al., 2013), and infer a 138
basal friction field along with a viscosity multiplier coefficientϕ(sometimes called an“enhancement 139
factor” (Minchew et al., 2018) ) as a proxy for the effects on ice viscosity of mismatches 140
between expected and actual damage, temperature fields, fabric, impurities, and liquid 141
water content (S. L. Cornford et al., 2015). As the name suggests,ϕmultiplies the vis- 142
cosity in Equation 1, which then becomes 143
τij= 2ϕη˙ε ij.(2)
While modelers generally assume that their models broadly represent the physics 144
of glacial ice, we note that this approach does not actually require that the rheology as- 145
sumed in the model be a particularly good representation of the physics of the observed 146
ice. John von Neumann would say, “Give me four parameters and I can fit an elephant; 147
with five I can make him wiggle his trunk”; given the number of parameters and nonunique- 148
ness in both the spatially varying basal friction and viscosity multiplier fields, there are 149
presumably many combinations which allow one to fit a model that assumesn= 3 in 150
Equation 1 to observations of an ice sheet regardless of the physical processes at work 151
(MacAyeal, 1993; Gudmundsson, 2003; Dyson, 2004) . 152
It is not yet possible to infer the values ofAandnin grounded areas where the 153
friction at the bed is unknown due to limitations in our observations and the uncertain- 154
ties in the inferences of the friction coefficient at the bed. As a result, while the process 155
of tuning basal friction and ice viscosity parameters to fit observations is effective in ini- 156
tializing models to modern observations, it can create uncertainties in time-dependent 157
evolution of models because constitutive parameters likengovern modeled ice sheet evo- 158
lution. To illustrate this point, consider that studies which infer the basal friction co- 159
efficient and the value ofA 0,3(assumingn= 3) show that values ofA 0,3tend to be larger 160
in areas of rapid shear and deformation [e.g., (Ranganathan, Minchew, Meyer, & Gud- 161
mundsson, 2021)]. The higher value ofA 0,3in these areas relative to the surrounding 162
areas indicates localized deformation, which is often attributed to a combination of crys- 163
tallographic fabric development and grain size evolution, local variations in ice temper- 164
ature, and damage (Hudleston, 2015; Minchew et al., 2018). However, increasingnfrom 165
3 to 4 is likely to further localize deformation in ice sheets (Turcotte & Schubert, 2014). 166

For initializations or short-term projections, this distinction in physical mechanisms may 167
not be important, but when evolving the model over long periods of time, it has the po- 168
tential to lead to different results because the value ofn, the development of fabric, lo- 169
cal shear heating, and the damage development lead to different rates and magnitudes 170
of change in viscosity.171
2.2 The MISMIP+ and ABUMIP Ice Sheet Model Benchmarks 172
To explore the ice-sheet-modeling consequences of errors inn, we use the MISMIP+ 173
benchmark (Asay-Davis et al., 2016; S. L. Cornford et al., 2020), which is designed to 174
explore the impact of ice shelf thinning (and resulting weakening of buttressing effects) 175
in marine ice sheets, currently believed to be a primary driver of Antarctic contributions 176
to SLR in the present day and for the next century. The ice sheet configuration (Fig- 177
ure 1) is a glacier in a trough with a section of retrograde bed. The basal friction and 178
surface mass balance are tuned to place the steady-state grounding line on the section 179
of retrograde slope indicating a balance between the various competing physics and ten- 180
dencies present. This steady-state configuration is then perturbed by introducing a depth- 181
dependent subshelf melt-rate, resulting in ice shelf thinning and weakening, reducing but- 182
tressing (the back-stress ice shelves exert on the upstream ice), which in turn results in 183
upstream acceleration, thinning, and grounding-line retreat. The configuration repre- 184
sents a simplified Pine Island Glacier, and is designed to explore the impact on marine 185
ice sheet systems of buttressing and ice-shelf weakening due to warm-water incursion as 186
has been observed in the Amundsen Sea Embayment in West Antarctica, where Pine Is- 187
land Glacier resides. A similar modeling benchmark, the ABUMIP experiments (Sun et 188
al., 2020), applies an extreme melt forcing to any floating ice, rapidly eliminating ice shelves. 189
This provides an indication of the maximum possible response to rapid ice shelf loss or 190
collapse, and can be an indication of marine ice sheet vulnerability (Martin et al., 2019). 191
In this work, we use the MISMIP+ and ABUMIP benchmark experiments to ex- 192
plore the consequences of initializing an ice sheet model which assumesn= 3 to ob- 193
servations of a marine ice sheet in whichn= 4. We do this by first generating an ice- 194
sheet state with an underlying rheology usingn= 4, then initializing ourn= 3 model 195
to match our synthetically “observed” thickness and velocity field following S. L. Corn- 196
ford et al. (2015). We then perform evolution experiments forced by specified sub-shelf 197
melting profiles to observe how then= 3 model differs from the truen= 4 behav- 198
ior. Using this idealized set up allows us to isolate precisely the consequences of assum- 199
ing a particular flow-law exponent on initializing and projecting the grounding line evo- 200
lution of an embayed ice shelf that buttresses a grounded glacier, like Pine Island, with- 201
out the compounding and trading-off uncertainties of basal friction or other mechanisms 202
that complicate searching for an initial state. By including the ABUMIP benchmark ex- 203
periment we furthermore explore a proxy for ice shelf collapse that hasn’t been consid- 204
ered in previous work on the impact ofnon the response to ice sheets to ocean-induced 205
melting (Getraer & Morlighem, 2025; Sergienko, 2025). 206
2.3 Ice Sheet Model207
Our numerical experiments employ the BISICLES model (S. Cornford et al., 2013), 208
which uses a variant of the vertically-integrated “L1L2” stress balance (Schoof & Hind- 209
marsh, 2010). BISICLES employs adaptive mesh refinement to ensure that fine mesh res- 210
olution is dynamically deployed as needed; for these experiments, mesh resolution ranges 211
from a coarsest resolution of 4 km in quiescent regions down to a finest resolution of 250 m 212
near grounding lines and regions of high strain rates. We use the Coulomb-limited basal 213
friction rule from Tsai et al. (2015). 214

stretched by 20x for clarity. More details in Asay-Davis et al. (2016).
2.4 MISMIP+ Spinup and Choosing a value forA n 215
The MISMIP+ experiment begins with a constant-temperature ice sheet, on a bed 216
with a constant basal-friction coefficient C andϕequal to unity, spun up to a steady- 217
state configuration without any subshelf melt forcing and with a constant surface accu- 218
mulation rate. The upstream boundary is taken to be an ice divide, and the lateral bound- 219
aries are free-slip. We choose values ofAand the basal friction coefficient so that a spun- 220
up steady-state ice sheet places its grounding line on the retrograde bed at the center- 221
line of the domain.222
For this experiment, we use the values of the basal friction coefficientCand ac- 223
cumulation rate ˙asuggested by Asay-Davis et al. (C= 1×104Pa m1
3a−1
3, ˙a= 3 m a−1) 224
and then choose the value ofAby running an ensemble of spin-up experiments to find 225
one in which the steady-state grounding line at the centerline of the domain is on the 226
retrograde slope (nearx= 550 km) per the MISMIP+ problem specification (Asay-Davis 227
et al., 2016). In then= 4 case, we found that a spatially constant value ofA 4= 1.9× 228
10−22Pa−4a−1(6.02×10−30Pa−4s−1) worked well. Following the approach outlined 229
in the Appendix, we calculateA 3=A 4τref= 1.71×10−17Pa−3a−1(5.46×10−25Pa−3s−1) 230
forτ ref= 90 kPa. This value ofA 3is comparable to the suggested value of 2.0×10−17Pa−3a−1231
from Asay-Davis et al. (2016). We define the reference stressτ ref= 90 kPa because 232
it produced aϕdistribution that is roughly symmetric and centered on the reference value 233
ϕ= 1.0. We note, however, that because the MISMIP+ experiment is a constant-temperature 234
ice sheet, our assumption for the value ofτ refmerely appears as a spatially constant pref- 235
actor to the viscosity, and will be compensated for when we computeϕduring the in- 236
version process. We tested this by confirming that changingτ refdid not result in a dif- 237
ferent initial viscosity.238

2.5 Inversion withn= 3 239
Once we obtained steady-staten= 4 MISMIP+ thickness and velocity fields and 240
a matchedn= 3 value for the rate-factorA 3, we initialized then= 3 model using 241
the approach described by S. L. Cornford et al. (2015) to infer spatially-varying basal 242
friction coefficient (C) and viscosity multiplier (ϕ) fields. Many, if not most, models per- 243
form initializations by inferring some combination of the basal friction field under grounded 244
ice along with a viscosity multiplier which usually is primarily active in the floating ice 245
shelves. Details of our inversion approach are described in the supplementary informa- 246
tion. The basal friction (C) and viscosity multiplier (ϕ) fields we computed are shown 247
in Figure 2. Note that our inversion attempts to compensate for the rheology mismatch 248
via small-magnitude (on the order of 1 percent) variations in the basal friction field, along 249
with a more-pronounced correction evident in theϕfield. Since we expect rheology mis- 250
matches to be better addressed via the viscosity multiplier, we can also leverage our prior 251
knowledge of the correct value ofCin the MISMIP+ problem specification and optimize 252
for the viscosity multiplierϕin isolation withCheld fixed at the prescribed value; we 253
expect that this approach will lead to a more-faithful representation of the correction 254
needed to matchn= 3 ice to truen= 4 ice. The resultingϕfield produced by this 255
second inversion is also shown in Figure 2. Whether inverting for basal friction or not, 256
to match then= 3 model to then= 4 synthetic observation requires viscosity re- 257
ductions in regions of high strain rates (red hues inϕin Figure 2), and a correspond- 258
ing increase in the viscosity in regions of low strain rates (blue hues). In short, we ex- 259
pect the magnitude of variations fromϕ= 1 to increase withn= 3. This is the ex- 260
pected consequence of the increased sensitivity to changes in viscosity withn= 4, hence 261
larger perturbations ofϕare required withn= 3 to produce the equivalent effect on 262
ice flow. The primary impact of including the basal friction coefficient in the inversion 263
is in the grounded ice, with little impact on the viscosity multiplier on floating sections 264
or at the grounding line.265
2.6 Evolution experiment 266
With then= 3 rheology initialized to then= 4 initial state via inversion, we 267
carry out a set of experiments for each rheology – a control experiment to confirm steady 268
state and a pair of retreat-and-advance experiments. For the control experiments, we sim- 269
ply restarted the configurations without any additional forcing. For the retreat and read- 270
vance experiment, we apply a prescribed subshelf depth-dependent basal melt rate to 271
represent the impact of climate forcing. Starting with the spun-up ice configuration, we 272
allow the ice sheet to retreat under the influence of melt for 100 years, after which we 273
turn off the melt and the ice sheet is allowed to recover, running out a total of 400 years. 274
We perform an additional control run of then= 3 rheology without the inversion-computed 275
viscosity multiplier field to identify the impact of the inversion. For the forced exper- 276
iments, we use two distinct forcing regimes.Moderateforcing uses the depth-dependent 277
melt formula prescribed in the original MISMIP+ experiment (Asay-Davis et al., 2016), 278
which represents currently-observed melt-forcing and shelf-thinning regimes, likely due 279
to incursions of subshelf warm water. A secondextremeforcing is based on the ABU- 280
MIP experiments (Sun et al., 2020) and is designed to represent extreme shelf loss and 281
collapse, like the collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf in 2002 (Scambos et al., 2004). The 282
experiments are tabulated in Table 1. Except where specifically indicated, we choose to 283
use the viscosity multiplier inverted with the (known) basal friction parameter rather 284
than the combined inversion to focus on the effects of the viscosity multiplier. 285

3.1 Moderate Melt Experiments 287
Figure 3 shows snapshots of the evolution of ice velocity, grounding line position 288
and upper ice surface elevation for then= 3 (ϕ-only inversion) andn= 4 moderate 289
melt experiments (Experiments 2 and 5 in Table 1). Figure 4 shows the evolution of the 290
grounded area (which is the sum of the ice sheet grounding line advance or retreat) and 291
the change in the total volume of ice above the flotation point (which corresponds to the 292
contribution to SLR in the absence of solid-earth and variable sea-level effects) for the 293
experiments in Table 1. The control runs maintain the initial condition, as expected for 294
a successful (and successfully inverted) steady-state, while the experiment runs initially 295
exhibit the expected thinning, grounding-line retreat, and reduction in volume above flota- 296
tion (corresponding to a positive contribution to SLR). When the melt forcing is turned 297
off after 100 years in the experiment runs, the ice sheet recovers, albeit at a slower rate 298
than the retreat.299
Notable observations from the results: 300
1. The steady-state configuration is well-maintained in both then= 3 andn= 4 301
control runs (Figure 4, Experiments 1 and 3). This points to the effectiveness of 302
the inversion-producedϕfield in enabling then= 3 ice sheet to match the ini- 303
tial steady-staten= 4 configuration. 304
2. Then= 3 control run withϕ= 1 (Experiment 4) experiences a small advance 305
and mass gain (Figure 4). This is a consequence of then= 3 rheology’s increased 306
viscosity and decreased sensitivity to changes in shear stress across the ice shelf 307
margin, allowing for a greater buttressing back-stress and the observed thicken- 308
ing and grounding line advance. This demonstrates the impact of theϕfield when 309
matching observations, and shows that it is relatively straightforward to match 310
ann= 3 ice sheet to a snapshot of observations of ann= 4 ice sheet using a 311
viscosity multiplier.312
3. Owing to its decreased sensitivity to changes in stress and higher initial viscos- 313
ity, then= 3 ice sheet in Experiment 5 noticeably under-predicts the initial re- 314
sponse of the ice sheet relative to then= 4 baseline in Experiment 2, with max- 315
imum reduction in grounded area 17.6% less than then= 4 response, and a cor- 316
responding 21% underestimate in the reduction in the volume above flotation (con- 317
tribution to SLR). These results are consistent with modeled projections of Antarc- 318
tica’s contribution to sea level rise as shown in Figure 1B of Fricker et al. (2025). 319

response time and allows faster draining of grounded ice than predicted withn= 321
3 Figures 3– 5.322
4. Conversely, in the recovery phase we see a faster response withn= 4, but while 323
then= 3 andn= 4 grounding lines have recovered similarly byt= 400 years, 324
the ice thickness (as expressed in the volume above flotation) has not recovered 325
to the same degree – it is noticeable in Figure 3 that while the grounding lines for 326
both cases are essentially identical, the ice thickness and velocity fields are notice- 327
ably different.328
5. Compared to differences with then= 4 evolutions, differences between then= 329
3 results using the two inversion approaches are relatively small, suggesting these 330
observations are robust regardless of the specific inversion approach used. 331
We can highlight the differences in response rates between then= 3 andn= 4 ice 332
sheets (Experiments 2 and 5) by plotting the relative difference (in percent) between the 333
n= 3 andn= 4 grounded areas and total volumes above flotation, as in Figure 5. 334
Again, notable features are that then= 3 case underestimates the rates of both re- 335
treat and readvance, and that the grounded area (grounding-line location) recovers much 336
more quickly than the ice volume. 337
3.2 Effect of Ice Shelf Collapse and Loss 338
Using the same MISMIP+ initial condition and inversion as before, we exposed the 339
ice shelves to the extreme melt forcing (ABUMIP) specified in Sun et al. (2020), essen- 340
tially removing any floating ice in a very short interval. 341
The resulting evolution of glacier flow, surface elevation, and grounding line po- 342
sition (Figure 6) along with total grounded area and volume above flotation (Figure 4) 343
broadly follow the same patterns as for the moderate-melt case. Under extreme melt con- 344
ditions, the less-sensitiven= 3 ice sheet retreats an additional 1.44×the grounded area 345
loss and sees a 1.64×reduction in volume above flotation compared to the moderate melt 346
case. The more-sensitiven= 4 ice sheet sees a difference of 1.59×in grounded area loss. 347
The response in total volume over flotation is also stark, contributing to global SLR at 348
1.86×the amount from the moderate-melt experiment. This represents an under-estimate 349
of SLR by then= 3 model of 35% after 100 years. Note that the discrepancy between 350
then= 3 andn= 4 response is more than proportionally larger (the ABUMIP re- 351
sponse divided by the MISMIP response is greater forn= 4 than forn= 3). Figure 352
7 shows the relative response (∆(V aF) ABUMIP
∆(V aF) MISMIP) indicating a larger sensitivity of then= 353
4 ice to extreme forcing relative to projections from then= 3 model. This discrepancy 354
in sensitivity is particularly pronounced in the initial dynamic phase of the experiments, 355
in which then= 4 ice sheet is as much as 50% more sensitive (defined by the ratio of 356
the ratios) to the more-extreme forcing. However, even in the long-term response, the 357
n= 4 sensitivity is 20% more than seen in then= 3 result. 358

4 Application to Pine Island Glacier 361
It is notable that the pattern our inversion retrieves in the viscosity multiplier closely 362
resembles the patterns that previous studies have tended to produce when attempting 363
to match observed Antarctic velocity fields withn= 3 models (e.g., S. L. Cornford et 364
al. (2015)). This pattern, characterized by sharply localized softening in shear margins 365
and diffuse hardening in regions of lower strain rates, can be observed in the upper-left 366
panel in Figure 8, which shows a viscosity multiplier field inverted to reproduce 2010 ve- 367

Details of the ASE inversions can be found in Supplementary Section S4. In this figure, 371
green hues indicate required increases to the viscosity and purple hues indicate required 372
softening. As with Figure 2, stiffening is required in the main trunks of the ice shelf, along 373
with softening in the shear margins. In the context of this work, the similarities suggest 374
that at least some of the computed viscosity modifications may result from employing 375
ann= 3 rheology in the inversion in regions where a different power-law better rep- 376
resents the actual flow of ice.377
If this is the case, then one could expect the level of correction imparted by the vis- 378
cosity multiplier to be less when using ann= 4 rheology compared to the standardn= 379
3 rheology. We performedn= 3 andn= 4 inversions based on ASE observations com- 380
piled in Morlighem (2022). Figure 8 showsϕfor the Pine Island Glacier Ice shelf, com- 381
puted vian= 3 andn= 4 inversions, and a representative cross-section across the 382
shelf. In this figure, it is apparent that then= 4 inversions infer noticeably less weak- 383
ening (about 10% less) in the shear margins, as expected based on our idealized exper- 384
iment. We also compute the difference between then= 3 andn= 4 viscosity multi- 385
pliers (shown in the middle-left panel in Figure 8). Sinceϕ= 1 in our idealizedn= 386
4 ice sheet, this difference is roughly equivalent to the deviation (ϕ−1) in the viscos- 387
ity multiplier shown in Figure 2. Red regions represent reduced viscosity (weakening), 388
and blue indicates increased viscosity (hardening) for then= 3 inversion relative to 389
then= 4 inversion. We see the same basic pattern as we see in Figure 2 – additional 390
weakening in the ice stream margins forn= 3 compared ton= 4, and some addi- 391
tional strengthening (blue) in the lower-stress regions in the ice-stream trunks. 392
Figure 8 also shows the distribution of the viscosity multiplierϕwithin the Pine 393
Island Glacier subdomain (bottom-right panel). Based on the results of our idealized ex- 394
periment, we expectϕto impose less of a correction for then= 4 case than for then= 395
3 inversion, which is what we see in the figure – the distribution ofϕ n=4is more closely 396
clustered around 1 (less corrective) than that forϕ n=3. That is consistent with a view 397
that the inclusion ofn= 4 processes such as dislocation creep better fits the true pic- 398
ture, but also consistent with a view that processes such as fabric formation can emu- 399
late highernin kilometer-scale observations of strain rates. 400

5 Discussion401
All ice-sheet model initializations require modelers to make assumptions and de- 402
cisions about which parameters to prescribe and which to infer by minimizing the mis- 403
fit between the model and observations. The results of these inversions can be used to 404
glean insights into the physical mechanisms acting in the ice sheets. For example, some 405
inferred viscosity multiplier (ϕ) values have been interpreted as damage in ice, which nat- 406
urally tend to occur in regions of high strain rate (C. P. Borstad et al., 2012; Bassis et 407
al., 2024) while others working in different areas of Antarctica highlight the importance 408
of fabric development, recrystallization, and internal shear heating and melting on ice 409
viscosity (Minchew et al., 2018; Ranganathan, Minchew, Meyer, & Gudmundsson, 2021; 410
Ranganathan, Minchew, Meyer, & Peˇ c, 2021). For compactness, we take “softening” to 411
refer to the combined effects of such local deviations from Glen’s Law as crevassing, mi- 412
croscopic cracking, warmer ice temperatures, interstitial water, recrystallization, and fab- 413
ric. The inversion results presented here suggest that at least part of what has been at- 414
tributed to damage and other softening processes may be the effect of matching ann= 415
3 model to observations of ann= 4 ice sheet. If true, this misattribution of physics 416
can have profound impacts on modeling efforts. For example, many efforts are under- 417
way to incorporate the physics of ice damage into ice sheet modeling efforts (C. Borstad 418
et al., 2016; Kachuck et al., 2022) – any attempts to validate these models using obser- 419
vations will be complicated by the presence of the effects of rheology mismatches. At the 420
level of this study, there is the parallel case where the true value ofnfor pure ice is in- 421
deed 3, but the softening processes captured by the viscosity multiplier act to cause ice 422
in real-world situations like the ASE to appear asn= 4 in data snapshots and short 423
time-series. We note in this case, however, that until robust and well-tested approaches 424
to evolveϕfields are developed along with longer data time-series that allow us to dis- 425
tinguish values ofnfrom other softening processes, it is likely thatn= 4 would remain 426
a better choice for modelers of large-scale marine ice sheets. Regardless, our results, com- 427
bined with those of Getraer and Morlighem (2025), show that reliable ensemble projec- 428
tions of ice sheet response and resulting contributions to sea level rise must include an 429
exploration of the known uncertainties in the viscous stress exponentn. 430
In both the MISMIP+ and ASE examples, we are able to match the initial and true 431
n= 4 thickness and velocity observations withn= 3 using a spatially varyingϕ. But 432
our model’s ability to evolve this field is rudimentary at best, and our initialization does 433
not reflect the transient nature of a real ice sheet. It is common practice to simply main- 434
tain this spatially-varyingϕfield as constant in time, as we do in our experiments. This 435
means that as the ice sheet evolves, the prescribed viscosity modifications will no longer 436

align with current stress fields in the ice, and will likely exert their own effects on the 437
ice dynamics. Even if one uses other models to evolve the viscosity multiplier, as is com- 438
mon with the application of damage fields, the response time of the shear-thinning vis- 439
cosity to changes in stress is instantaneous in the model, while different processes like 440
heating and damage evolution respond over finite timescales to changes in the stress en- 441
vironment (Ranganathan et al., 2025; Hills et al., 2023). 442
Our results suggest that the impact of buttressing in ice shelves may be over-estimated 443
in the idealized experiments designed and carried out for then= 3 rheology, such as 444
the MISMIP+ experiment and related MISOMIP experiments, designed to explore the 445
coupling between local ocean warming and ice sheet retreat. These have generally been 446
used to gain insight into the relative importance of buttressing and other ice-dynamic 447
effects. The stronger stress-concentration and coincident weakening via viscosity reduc- 448
tion present in ann= 4 rheology reduce the ability of the ice shelf to maintain and 449
transmit the stresses that provide buttressing through lateral shear stresses inn= 3 450
models. This manifest itself during the generation of a steady-state MISMIP+ initial con- 451
dition for ourn= 4 ice sheet – the reduced impact of buttressing resulted in different 452
initial condition values than for the standardn= 3 experiment. Consequently, glaciol- 453
ogists looking for insight from benchmarks performed withn= 3 may also overesti- 454
mate the impacts of buttressing effects in projections of real-world ice sheets. 455
Finally, we note that uncertainties due to the value ofncompound with other un- 456
certainties. As shown in Figure 7, the difference betweenn= 3 andn= 4 projections 457
increases more than proportionally for larger forcings, implying that ice sheets which fol- 458
low ann= 4 rheology will exhibit a greater spread between lower and upper bound 459
response than we currently see with projections which employn= 3. This functions 460
as an uncertainty multiplier. For instance, uncertainty around time scales of ice shelf weak- 461
ening ranges from the rapid disintegration of the Larsen B Ice Shelf to the more mod- 462
erate (but still substantial) thinning seen in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (represented 463
here by the ABUMIP and MISMIP+ forcing regimes). Incorporating these together, one 464
now sees a range of more than 2×in SLR after 100 years between the n=3 moderate melt 465
and the n=4 shelf collapse results. This finding underscores the likelihood that both the 466
magnitude and uncertainties in current sea level rise projections are severely underes- 467
timated and that a more thorough and systematic sensitivity analysis of ice sheet mod- 468
els to the value ofnis needed.469
6 Conclusions470
In this work, we show that it is possible for ann= 3 ice sheet model to success- 471
fully match the state of an observedn= 4 ice sheet, while potentially misattributing 472
the rheology mismatch to other physics like ice damage, ice fabric, or temperature. The 473
results of ourn= 3 runs substantially under-predict the sensitivity and response time 474
of ice shelves to changes in both external and internal forcings, leading to differences in 475
both the amount and rate of grounding line retreat and contributions to sea level rise. 476
This is likely because the viscosity multiplier is required to be fixed in time for model 477
initialization, an algorithmic consequence not grounded in the reality of a time-dependent 478
ice rheology.479
Looking forward, it is apparent that further sensitivity studies are needed in more- 480
realistic configurations, and projections of sea-level rise must take into account uncer- 481
tainties in the viscous flow law parameters, particularly the exponentnand prefactor 482
A, to effectively capture the range of potential responses to various forcings. Our model, 483
like other ice-flow models used to simulate the behavior of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, strongly 484
depends on the prescribed value ofnto capture the viscous responses to stress pertur- 485
bations caused by both external climate forcing and the internal variability. As such, ac- 486

curately capturing the viscous stresses within glacier ice is a primary control governing 487
our ability to predict the future of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. 488
Appendix A A note on the viscosity prefactorA 489
Ice properties represented byA n(Equation 1) in current ice sheet models have been 490
fitted in the context ofn= 3 rheologies. We have no assurances that thesen= 3 val- 491
ues are consistent with other values of the flow-law exponent, and in fact they are di- 492
mensionally inconsistent. To test other flow law exponents, we can exploit the fact that 493
the viscositiesη n=3andη n=4will be equal at some reference stressτ ref. We can then 494
hold viscosity constant and adjust the value ofA nin Equation 1 such that 495
η=τ1−n
ref
2An=τ1−m

2Am.(A1)
If we assume that we know the strain rates at the particular stressτ=τ ref(equiva- 496
lent to knowing the viscosity at a particular stress), then 497
Am=A 3τ(3−m)
ref,(A2)
which provides a simple way to incorporate the temperature-dependent correlations for 498
A developed over the past few decades (which assumedn= 3) to modeling ice in which 499
n= 4. Conversely, if we’re starting in a modeled world whereinn= 4, we can com- 500
pute the equivalent value forA 3using the following: 501
A3=A 4τref (A3)
and we can write the viscosity502
η3=A−1
4τrefτ−2(A4)
Following from this approach, we can see that the viscosityη 3will be greater than 503
η4for stresses greater thanτ ref(τ > τ ref) and vice-versa (i.e.,η 4< η3forτ < τ ref), 504
as expected for a rheology less sensitive to changes in stress. 505
Moreover, in equation 2 above, the viscosity multiplier multiplies the viscosity in 506
equation A4:507
η3=ϕA−1
4τrefτ−2.(A5)
In our idealized setup, this illustrates why neither the choice of the reference stress nor 508
the initial rate factor should affect the ability to initialize then= 3 experiment. As 509
a product of all these factors, the inversion cannot distinguish between them. 510
